> This app makes calls from an API to request address info.

In this Single Page Aplication (SPA) I used **Vue.js** with Javascript ECMA 6 and CSS to build an app that calls an API to request address info. This app also use **Google Maps API** to show a map of the location.

## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report

# run unit tests
npm run unit

# run all tests
npm test
```
